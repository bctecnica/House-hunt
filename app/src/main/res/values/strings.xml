        Welcome, the aim is for players to scavenge as many items as possible to build the largest
        collection of loot before the end of the 10 rounds.\n\n
        Grownups must read the items popping up on their screen and keep a tally of the players
        points. A two minute timer can be added to increase difficulty.\n\n
        Good luck and happy scavenging!!!
